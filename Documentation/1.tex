\section{Project Overview}
\subparagraph{ The project highlights the results of a danger situation immediately when a person get in a situation of  harrasment. One of the goals of this project is to get the situation viral on a platform and any people in a particular division can view either they are people or law enforcement people. If the situation need overcome by this process, the victim can save their live, and the people will have a freedom and a crime free generation.}

\subsection{Project Purpose}
\subparagraph{The main goal of this project is to viral the situation by anyone or the victim  and overcome by any people or law enforcement service. For this process, people will get a reliable help progress for viral the situation and someone who can admit into it. }
 
\subsection{Background}
\subparagraph{The background for this project will give a viral news so that any people or the police can know  on that location has been compromise. Someone need help on that place and any person can help on that for give proper solution in that exact location.}


\section{Benfits and Beneficieries}
\subparagraph{The benfits will provide both the victim,the law enformance and the govt in bangladesh. People can save their situation and govt canimprove the law and have a clear image on victim. For this a yearly survey can also help to improve. The primary focus is to ensure as fast as viral the help and help the prople in any area.}

\section{Goals}
\subparagraph{This project will improve the citizen with the real time extra advantages for proper solution keeping the report they request for viral. It will have the 
nearby solution as much as possible. we can see the emergency sos system can only track the police, but in this system a specific nearby and the law enforcement both can help to track the problem and save as much as possible of their lives.}

\section{Project Schedule}
\paragraph{First, I have to implement the idea about how actually people get into troble. Then need a specific place where they cna connected by a large area of agent who actually can help. Time is very important for solving a problem in a specific area. So. Govt. service holder can review actually what happends and how to solve it. The whole system need to monitorize for ensuring security for  the people}

\subsection{Gantt Chart}
\paragraph{Gantt Chart have to devided by 3 section}

\subsection{Release Plan/Milestone}
\paragraph{The Plan is mainly for viral any situation in a platform where people can see that and give help or speard news for safety and for the situation. This idea can help the people for awareness at anywhere. This idea can developed a system where any specific area problem can identify by govt services and also people who actually need emergency help by viral the situation. }

\section{Data Requirements}

\section{Performance Requirements}
\subsection{Speed and Latency Requirement}

\paragraph{When we use game or use satellite internet, latency can have a big impact on your online experience. In Whistleblower the main page use dynamic programing for get into the chat system. The chat system is the main concept for the idea to help the local people for solving or saving people. So, the system is mainly need real time chat system for this environment. So, we have to use minimum speed and ping for sending and receving data for the exect location. In a
chat platform.120-140ms is optimal for active status. Sending photos and vedios with needs minimum bandwidth which in this system is need some sending bandwidth speed. As a chat system, the medium speed needs to requir for this environment}

\newpage
\subsection{Precision or Accuracy Requirements }
\paragraph{In our country a platform like open chat system is new idea for emergency and accuracy which can help to improve less crime in almost everywhere. This platform require a 
simple easy accuracy for any people for sending text or location for help and the complexity of this system is much faster for the server.}
\subsection{Capacity Requirements}
\paragraph{Capacity requirement meets the full capacity of the system. Ths platform meets the full requirements for emergency help with the people. 
The server gives proper response because  the backend development. The froentend platform is also very fast }

\section{Dependability Requirements}
\subsection{Reliability Requirements}
\paragraph{The Whistleblower system gives a real time solution in a open chat system which can monitored by the law enforcement agency 
which can solve and give a proper solution by given access. This system is robustly help the local people if they have face a problem by bad kind of people. And in emergency they can share their locaiton and ask for helpseaker. The helpseaker also can help them by verify theirselves in law enforcement. So in reality this can be a future solution for vital news and solution. The testing can improve the reliability requirement like subdomain, auth, cross-site for the system. The more test in the system, the better solution for the platform.}

\subsection{Availability Requirements }
\paragraph{The availability in this system is very independent. Every people can use this system as their life saving or any problem solution. This platform is based on division wise traking location for viral situation or any other problems that we face in our daily life. People can use the whistleblower page for give some information which can monitor by law enforcement, helpseaker and any other people in the viral area.
 They can also ask in the chat platform if they want some valuable information and someone can help as a helpseaker}

\newpage
\subsection{Robustness or Fault-Tolerance Requirements }
\paragraph{This system helps to  resist the problem that people facing in the street or any place which we can see in those days in both men and women.
So , in this emergency situation vital solution needs to concern at any location. Now, suppose a women gets harrash in public place. Someone see that and post in whistleblower page.Their will be 
no fault tolerance for viral the system  cause law enforcement always monitor the problem for finding the solution. And it any fault problem post, then punishment will be require with the nid profile.So less tolerance can not be 
ensure in this system.
}

\subsection{Safety-Critical Requirements}
\paragraph{This platform is more safety for local people because their will be no platform abusement for the law enforcement and helpseaker. The police can also help in this problems. So safety critical requirement are less in whistleblower
 chat system.In this system almost every women gets in problem in many place. So helpseaker can asked for help by giving their identity for ensuring the need for help.Safety is more important at any place in our country. Chances for solution is 
widely in this system. Critical situaltion of this platform are most reliable for the people of our county.}

\newpage
\section{Maintainability and Supportability Requirements}
\paragraph{Maintanance requirement}
\subparagraph{Maintainability is the valuable plan for a system. In this project maintain is the most important thing for covering the situation.
Because In a system like open chat system and monitor by law enforcement agents, their will a chance to get hack or system loss by social engineering.
So, the testing needs to be performed in a sequence way so that can not be hacked by the others.}

\paragraph{Supportability requirement}
\subparagraph{Supportability need to require for a system. In this platform law enforcement agent can a hugh amount for supporting the system.They can track anyone if their is any problem.
Law enforcement support can help for data analyst also.In every year submitted problem, disclose and other critical problem might be survey for support and control over by this process.}

\paragraph{Adaptability Requirements}
\subparagraph{The adaptability requiremt need to focus on mission-driven planning for the system. Component based system so that 
it can be implement when it need to update. This adaptibility can be focus on code requirement where developer can help to upgrade and build the system. In this term coding implementation is important for future.}
\paragraph{Scalability or Extensibility Requirements}
\subparagraph{For scalability or extension we can use this system into other platform or mobile operator services. This can be more efficient if people use the cell emergency services for the emergency help. And another thing that people need this system into more feasible like one tap help or location sending message.}


\newpage
\section{Security Requirements}
\paragraph{Access Requirements}
\subparagraph{For every system, data is important for everyone. So access must be secure with a sequence security assurance for the environment.
Each access needs to require with cryptography for storing or accessing the platform. weather it is require for the local people , but their will be focused on law agencies so that they can serve the services
to the local people . Accessing local's data for helping is nessessary for this system. So it wiil be a security process for the platform.
}
\paragraph{Integrity Requirements}
\subparagraph{In data integrity requirement, there will three key attributes:Completeness, accuracy and consistency.A good database will enforce data integrity whenever possible.If the system enforces data integrity, it will prevent the user from making these mistakes.
So, we need to }
\paragraph{Privacy Requirements}
\subparagraph{the privacy requirement must subsantiate this system's compliance with security fundamental privacy.
The fastest way to private and secure in open platform is to secure and implement section wise lookup and extra security for the law enforcement services.
Component -based represents a significant advance towards system by plugging independent and reusable components.So , it makes proper security system.}
